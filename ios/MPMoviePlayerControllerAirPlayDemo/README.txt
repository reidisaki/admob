This XCode project is a simple integration with the FreeWheel AdManager SDK.

The project aims to show how a developer would integrate the FreeWheel Admanager with a content video player to play preroll/postroll ads delivered by the FreeWheel ad server. 
The current implementation of this specific project does not support UI response to rotation events. 
FreeWheel's Ad SDK fully support ad rotation and proper response to rotation events; please contact a Freewheel sales engineer for additional implementation details.

For additional functionality examples such as midroll ads, live event monetization, rich media ads, ad networks (admob, iad, Rhythm New Media, etc), please contact FreeWheel Sales Engineer for the appropriate example package.
